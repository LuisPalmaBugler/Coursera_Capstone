Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an **Coffee Shop** in **Toronto**, Canada.\n\n\nConsidering that the success of the Coffee Shop operation depends on several factors, in this analysis we will address two. One is the number of Coffee Shop that already exist in the neighbourhood, since these will be the competition of our Coffee Shop. The second is the number of consumers who attend the competing Coffee Shops since these are the potential consumers for ours.\n\nFinally, a segmentation and classification of neighbourhoods will be carried out based on the criteria indicated to determine the one that meets the ideal condition, that is, a neighbourhood with a low density of Coffee Shop and a high number of consumers per Coffee Shop."
